# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator.

# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty itself.
# env:
# TERM variable
#
# This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
# each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
# check the local terminfo database and use 'alacritty' if it is
# available, otherwise 'xterm-256color' is used.
#
# TERM: xterm-256color

window:
  # Window dimensions (changes require restart)
  #
  # Specified in number of columns/lines, not pixels.
  # If both are `0`, this setting is ignored.
  dimensions:
    columns: 80
    lines: 24

  dynamic_title: true

  # Background opacity
  #
  # Window opacity as a floating point number from `0.0` to `1.0`.
  # The value `0.0` is completely transparent and `1.0` is opaque.
  opacity: 0.9

  # Window padding (changes require restart)
  #
  # Blank space added around the window in pixels. This padding is not scaled
  # by DPI and the specified value is always added at both opposing sides.
  padding:
    x: 2
    y: 2

  # Window decorations
  #
  # Values for `decorations`:
  #     - full: Borders and title bar
  #     - none: Neither borders nor title bar
  decorations: none

# scrolling:
#   # Maximum number of lines in the scrollback buffer.
#   # Specifying '0' will disable scrolling.
#   history: 10000
#
#   # Number of lines the viewport will move for every line scrolled when
#   # scrollback is enabled (history > 0).
#   multiplier: 3
#
#   # Faux Scrolling
#   #
#   # The `faux_multiplier` setting controls the number of lines the terminal
#   # should scroll when the alternate screen buffer is active. This is used
#   # to allow mouse scrolling for applications like `man`.
#   #
#   # Specifying `0` will disable faux scrolling.
#
# Scroll to the bottom when new text is written to the terminal.

# Spaces per Tab (changes require restart)
#
# This setting defines the width of a tab in cells.
#
# Some applications, like Emacs, rely on knowing about the width of a tab.
# To prevent unexpected behavior in these applications, it's also required to
# change the `it` value in terminfo when altering this setting.

# Font configuration (changes require restart)
#
# Important font attributes like antialiasing, subpixel aa, and hinting can be
# controlled through fontconfig. Specifically, the following attributes should
# have an effect:
#   - hintstyle
#   - antialias
#   - lcdfilter
#   - rgba
#
# For instance, if you wish to disable subpixel antialiasing, you might set the
# rgba property to `none`. If you wish to completely disable antialiasing, you
# can set antialias to `false`.
#
# Please see these resources for more information on how to use fontconfig:
#   - https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/font_configuration#Fontconfig_configuration

# Visual Bell
#
# Any time the BEL code is received, Alacritty "rings" the visual bell. Once
# rung, the terminal background will be set to white and transition back to the

# configure the transition function by setting the `animation` property.
#
# Values for `animation`:

#   - EaseOutCubic
